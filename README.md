<h1>Hi, I'm Karl! I am aspiring to be a cybersecurity & IT professional with a background in nuclear medicine, PACS administrator, and USMC. Having completed Rice University's immersive 24-week cybersecurity bootcamp, I gained exposure to key cybersecurity areas, including network, system, web, and application security, digital forensics, penetration testing, vulnerability management, malware analysis, cryptography, encryption, intrusion detection, and risk management. Moreover, I learned how to utilize a wide range of cybersecurity tools and systems, including Wireshark, Metasploit, Hashcat, Burp Suite, and Kali Linux, as well as writing Bash and Powershell scripts. All of the above has given me experience in confidentiality, integrity, and accountability; as well as experience in the importance of keeping intel secure and knowledge of the "best practices" required to securing data and a high level of threat detection.

Having established a successful record in nuclear medicine for over two decades, I have demonstrated exceptional organizational and communication skills, as well as adaptability, prioritization, time management, problem-solving, and resource allocation aptitudes. Moreover, I demonstrated a unique aptitude to identify technical issues and security gaps, develop mitigating solutions, and accelerate improvement.
